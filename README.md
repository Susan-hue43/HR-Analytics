# Introduction
In this Power BI case study, we explore a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. The focus is on importing, analyzing, and visualizing Human Resources data in Power BI. We conducted exploratory data analysis and used DAX to build powerful visualizations. The analysis delves into attrition and the factors influencing it, helping Atlas Labs determine actions to retain more employees.

Attrition, in an HR context, refers to the reduction of staff numbers through resignation, retirement, or death, rather than through layoffs. High attrition rates can indicate underlying issues within an organization that need addressing to improve employee retention.

## Problem Statement
Atlas Labs seeks a report to enhance their HR analytics, focusing on diversity and inclusion, employee performance, and demographics, as well as identifying factors influencing attrition.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Modeling in Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI
- Data Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Dashboard Creation
- Creating Reporting

## Data Sourcing
The data, provided by DataCamp, consists of five tables:
1. **Performance Rating**: 6709 rows, 11 columns
2. **Employee**: 1470 rows, 23 columns
3. **Education Level**: 5 rows, 2 columns
4. **Rating Level**: 5 rows, 2 columns
5. **Satisfied Level**: 5 rows, 2 columns

## Data Transformation
The dataset required minimal transformations to ensure readiness for analysis. The key change made was adding a custom column AgeBins in the Employee table for demographics analysis.

## Modeling
Data modeling is a crucial step in Power BI report development as it connects different data tables in star or snowflake schemas. In this case, a *star schema* is used. The schema centers around the FactPerformanceRating table, which stores key performance metrics. Surrounding dimension tables (DimEmployee, DimEducationLevel, DimDate, DimSatisfiedLevel, and DimRatingLevel) provide contextual information, enabling detailed data analysis and efficient reporting.
